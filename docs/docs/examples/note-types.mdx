## 📘 Note - General Information

### Purpose

Use notes for general information, definitions, background context, or explanations that help readers understand the content better.

### When to Use

- Providing additional context
- Explaining terminology
- Offering related information
- Clarifying concepts
- Adding supplementary details

### Example

> [!note]
> This plugin uses the unified/remark ecosystem for markdown processing. If you're new to remark, check out the [official documentation](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) to learn more about how it works.

### Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Keep notes informative but concise
- Use for non-critical supplementary information
- Provide helpful context without interrupting flow
- Link to additional resources when relevant

❌ **Don't:**
- Use for urgent warnings (use Important instead)
- Overuse - too many notes reduce impact
- Include critical setup steps (use Important)

### Markdown Syntax

```markdown
> [!note]
> This is a standard note that provides additional information to the reader.
```

### Accessibility Note

Notes use semantic `<blockquote>` elements and include proper ARIA labels for screen readers.

## 💡 Tip - Helpful Advice

### Purpose

Use tips to share best practices, expert advice, helpful shortcuts, or recommendations that improve the reader's experience or results.

### When to Use

- Sharing best practices
- Offering optimization suggestions
- Providing pro tips or shortcuts
- Recommending better approaches
- Highlighting efficiency improvements

### Example

> [!tip]
> For better performance in production, disable style injection and import the CSS file directly in your layout. This enables better caching and reduces runtime overhead.

### Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Share actionable, practical advice
- Focus on improvements and optimizations
- Keep tips specific and valuable
- Explain why the tip is helpful

❌ **Don't:**
- State obvious information
- Use for warnings (use Important)
- Make tips too generic
- Forget to explain the benefit

### Markdown Syntax

```markdown
> [!tip]
> Here's a helpful tip that can improve your workflow or code quality.
```

### Real-World Examples

> [!tip]
> When using with Next.js App Router, import the CSS in your root layout for optimal performance:
> ```typescript
> // app/layout.tsx
> import 'remark-notes-plugin/styles.css';
> ```

## ⚠️ Important - Critical Information

### Purpose

Use important notes for critical information that readers must not miss - warnings, requirements, prerequisites, breaking changes, or potential issues.

### When to Use

- Highlighting breaking changes
- Warning about potential issues
- Stating requirements or prerequisites
- Emphasizing critical setup steps
- Preventing common mistakes
- Security considerations

### Example

> [!important]
> This plugin requires Node.js 14 or higher and remark v13+. Using older versions will result in compatibility issues.

### Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Be clear and specific about the issue
- Explain the consequences
- Provide solutions when possible
- Use sparingly to maintain impact
- Front-load critical information

❌ **Don't:**
- Overuse - reduces effectiveness
- Use for general tips
- Be vague or unclear
- Forget to explain why it's important

### Markdown Syntax

```markdown
> [!important]
> This information is crucial and requires your attention to avoid issues or errors.
```

### Real-World Examples

> [!important]
> When using with SSR frameworks like Next.js, set `injectStyles: false` to prevent hydration mismatches. Import the CSS in your layout instead.

> [!important]
> Invalid note types (like `[!warning]`) will silently fail and render as plain blockquotes. Only use supported types: note, tip, important, quote, bonus.

## 💬 Quote - Quotations & Highlights

### Purpose

Use quote notes for testimonials, citations, memorable quotes, or to highlight specific text in a visually distinct way.

### When to Use

- Displaying user testimonials
- Citing sources or authorities
- Highlighting memorable quotes
- Showcasing feedback
- Emphasizing key statements

### Example

> [!quote]
> "This plugin transformed our documentation from plain and boring to engaging and professional. The GitHub-compatible syntax made migration effortless!"  
> — DevOps Team Lead, Tech Startup

### Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Include attribution when appropriate
- Use for actual quotes or testimonials
- Keep quotes relevant to context
- Consider length - shorter is better
- Use proper quotation marks

❌ **Don't:**
- Fabricate quotes
- Use for general information (use Note)
- Omit attribution for famous quotes
- Make quotes too long

### Markdown Syntax

```markdown
> [!quote]
> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." — Alan Kay
```

### Real-World Examples

> [!quote]
> "Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible."  
> — John Gruber, Creator of Markdown

## ⭐ Bonus - Advanced Features

### Purpose

Use bonus notes for advanced techniques, optional features, power-user tips, or extra value content that goes beyond the basics.

### When to Use

- Sharing advanced techniques
- Describing optional features
- Providing expert-level tips
- Offering additional value
- Going beyond basic usage
- Showcasing hidden features

### Example

> [!bonus]
> Advanced users can create custom note styles by disabling default injection and creating their own CSS classes that match your design system. See the [CSS Customization guide](/docs/customization/styling) for details.

### Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Provide genuine additional value
- Target intermediate/advanced users
- Link to detailed documentation
- Make it optional and supplementary
- Explain the benefits

❌ **Don't:**
- Include essential information (use Note/Important)
- Make it too complex without explanation
- Use for basic tips (use Tip)
- Forget to link to detailed guides

### Markdown Syntax

```markdown
> [!bonus]
> Here's an advanced technique that can further enhance your implementation.
```

### Real-World Examples

> [!bonus]
> You can use custom class prefixes to run multiple instances of the plugin with different styles on the same page:
> ```javascript
> .use(remarkNotes, { classPrefix: 'sidebar' })
> .use(remarkNotes, { classPrefix: 'main' })
> ```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Multiple Paragraphs

All note types support multiple paragraphs, lists, code blocks, and other markdown elements:

> [!tip]
> When structuring complex notes, follow these guidelines:
>
> 1. Start with the key message
> 2. Provide supporting details
> 3. Include examples when helpful
>
> ```javascript
> // Example code
> unified()
>   .use(remarkNotes)
>   .process(content);
> ```
>
> This keeps your notes organized and scannable.

**Syntax:**
```markdown
> [!tip]
> First paragraph.
>
> Second paragraph with a list:
> - Item 1
> - Item 2
>
> ```js
> // Code block
> ```
```

### Nested Elements

You can include various markdown elements:

> [!note]
> **Supported markdown elements:**
>
> - **Bold** and *italic* text
> - [Links](https://example.com)
> - `inline code`
> - Lists (ordered and unordered)
> - Code blocks
> - Images (use sparingly)
> 
> Complex formatting works seamlessly!

### Combining Note Types

Use different types strategically in your documentation:

> [!note]
> The `classPrefix` option prepends a custom string to all CSS classes.

> [!tip]
> Use a prefix that matches your project's naming convention, like `docs-` or `blog-`.

> [!important]
> The default CSS uses attribute selectors, so it works with any prefix automatically.

> [!bonus]
> Advanced CSS users can target specific prefixes for granular control over different sections.

## Choosing the Right Type

### Decision Tree

```
Is it critical information that could cause errors?
├─ YES → Use [!important]
└─ NO ↓

Is it practical advice or a best practice?
├─ YES → Use [!tip]
└─ NO ↓

Is it a quotation or testimonial?
├─ YES → Use [!quote]
└─ NO ↓

Is it advanced/optional information?
├─ YES → Use [!bonus]
└─ NO → Use [!note]
```

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Wrong:**
```markdown
> [!note]
> WARNING: This will delete all your data!
```

**✅ Right:**
```markdown
> [!important]
> This operation permanently deletes all data. Create a backup before proceeding.
```

---

**❌ Wrong:**
```markdown
> [!important]
> You might want to use TypeScript for better development experience.
```

**✅ Right:**
```markdown
> [!tip]
> Use TypeScript for better development experience with autocomplete and type safety.
```

---

## Accessibility Considerations

All note types are designed with accessibility in mind:

- **Semantic HTML:** Uses `<blockquote>` elements
- **Color Independence:** Information isn't conveyed by color alone
- **Screen Readers:** Proper heading hierarchy and ARIA labels
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Fully keyboard accessible
- **Contrast Ratios:** WCAG AA compliant color combinations

> [!note]
> The icons are decorative (aria-hidden) and the note type is provided as text, ensuring screen reader users get the same information as sighted users.
